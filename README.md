## The files you see in this directory correspond to a section/lesson of this video:
### https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvCiNeLnZ00

## The content list is as listed below: 
### Lesson 1: Build backend of the project, without frontend and DB
### Lesson 2: Build the middleware of the project, logging mechanisms, cors etc.
### Lesson 3: Connect the project with DB (MongoDB in our case), and the Model Schemas
### Lesson 4: Build the controller classes

## General Instructions:
- In order to run each project, you need to have node and npm installed on your local machine (just google it).
- Also you need to have a MondoDB URI (meaning a mongoDB cluster configured on https://www.mongodb.com/).
- Make sure to put that string(MongoDB URI), inside the .env file that you will have to create inside the project

## To install the project, just navigate in the folder that you want to run and type the command: 
```sh
npm update
```

## To run the project type the command:
```sh
npm run dev (for development)
```
